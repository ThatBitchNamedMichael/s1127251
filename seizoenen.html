      <h2>Season 1</h2>
      <p> In the study group's first year they are taking Spanish. Over the year we see the strong bonds that form between each of them. Jeff and Britta's flirtation continues. Troy and Abed's friendship start what will become an epic bromance and the beginnings of another possible romance is laid out as another one ends. As their freshmen year continues, the group take on the school bully and his minions ("Comparative Religion"), form a chicken finger mafia ("Contemporary American Poultry"), participate in the campus destroying first paintball assassination game ("Modern Warfare"). The semester concludes with The Tranny Dance where a love triangle ends with a shocking romantic cliffhanger ("Pascal's Triangle Revisited").</p>

      <h2>Season 2</h2>
      <p>In the study group's second year they are taking Anthropology together. Jeff deals with the consequences of his actions at the Tranny Dance which leads repercussions for him throughout this semester. Pierce gets into an accident, breaking his legs. He grows dependent on painkillers and becomes alienated from the study group. His increasingly nasty behavior causes them to exclude him from their activities. The other members of the group secretly took a vote about whether they'd include him in the group next year, and only Annie voted to keep him in; by the end of the semester, the other group members have reconsidered and are willing to let him back in the group, but Pierce claims he's not interested in returning.</p>
