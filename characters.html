    <h1>Jeff Winger</h1>
    <p> Jeff Winger is a former lawyer who enrolls at Greendale after being suspended by the state bar for falsely claiming to have a bachelor's degree. Jeff is a sarcastic, outspoken, overconfident, narcissist lothario who constantly manipulates people to get what he wants, which is often to not do any work. Jeff first created the study group to date Britta. Britta needed help studying and with Abed's help Jeff pretended to be a board certified Spanish tutor. However, as he becomes closer to his new study group he changes some of his habits and views. Most of the study group (with the exception of Britta) tend to idolize Jeff for his charisma, and often seek advice from him. Although he initially dislikes his role as the group's straight man and tries to appear apathetic to their concerns before begrudgingly helping them, Jeff is more willing to make personal sacrifices for his friends over time and selectively reveals that he can be more patient and less critical than what other "alpha-males" typically offer.</p>

<h1>Britta Perry</h1>
<p> Britta Perry is an anarchist, atheist, and activist who traveled around the world after dropping out of high school. Britta attempts to come off as proactive, intelligent, and mature to others, but she often comes off as pretentious and hypocritical in her views, especially those concerning her goal to become a therapist starting in season 3. This has led the other group members to view Britta as being a negative influence on the group, as evidenced by her taste in mentally damaged men, and her tendency to make things go wrong. Despite not being as worldly or well-informed an activist as she thinks she is, Britta has a genuine and powerful desire to help others, and has significant enthusiasm and energy in what she puts her efforts into (whether appropriate or misplaced).</p>

    <h1>Troy Barnes</h1>
    <p> Troy Barnes a former high school star quarterback who lost his scholarship to a top-tier university when he separated both shoulders doing a keg flip, which he actually did on purpose in order to escape the pressures of his stardom and popularity. Troy starts the series trying to appear cool and acting like a bully and a stereotypical football player, but he eventually feels comfortable in embracing his nerdy and carefree side, particularly in him becoming best friends with Abed. Troy generally struggles with the idea of becoming older, often looking to Jeff and Pierce for guidance, despite already showing signs of being capable of leadership and connecting the group together.

<section class="back">
<h1>Abed Nadir</h1>
<p> Abed Nadir is a film student of Palestinian and Polish descent, with an encyclopedic knowledge of TV shows and movies. Abed struggles to interact with others via conventional means due to his implied autism, so he often chooses to interpret the group's everyday activities by comparing them to film and TV clich√©s. Despite being out-of-touch with reality at times, Abed is a keen observer of human behavior and often the wisest member of the group. These eccentricities allow him to pick up on flaws the other characters have and tend to bluntly point them out, eventually resulting in the characters learning from his insights.

    <h1>Annie Edison</h1>
    <p> Annie Edison is the youngest of the group, a compulsive overachiever, relentlessly organized and comparatively innocent. Annie was extremely unpopular in high school and formerly addicted to Adderall, which has caused her to be very anxious and desperate to prove herself in a variety of extra-curricular groups despite already being considered naturally intelligent and attractive by others. Though normally kind-hearted, she can quickly turn obsessive or lose her temper when she fails to achieve or is denied something she strongly cares about. However, her friendship with Jeff, as well as her living situation with Troy and Abed, slowly allow her to become more laid-back and genial.

<p> Shirley Bennett a divorced mother and vocal Christian going to school to start a brownie business. Shirley is a kind-hearted person with strong morals, but can be overbearing and often resorts to using guilt in her interactions with her friends. Though soft-spoken, Shirley has a quick temper, a characteristic that manifests when she is advocating for herself or her friends. It is often implied that Shirley's Christian beliefs, which she tends to impose on most non-Christians around her, are a means of coping with her anger issues and to repress the stress she deals with in raising her family while also dealing with school.</p>

    <h1>Pierce Hawthorne</h1>
    <p> Pierce Hawthorne a millionaire and CEO of the Hawthorne Wipes moist towelette company who enrolled at Greendale a decade prior to the start of the series out of boredom and a passive attempt at self-discovery. More than anyone else within the study group, Pierce is often at odds with the rest of the group because of his arrogance, lack of empathy, and casual ignorance of politically correct behavior, all of which largely stem from his old age and his emotionally abusive father. This includes believing Britta is a closeted lesbian, mispronouncing Abed's name, and lusting over Shirley. He also tends to envy the other group members, particularly Jeff's relative youthful attractiveness and Abed's close friendship with Troy. Despite his often unsociable and selfish nature, Pierce desperately wants to fit in with the group and occasionally offers great insight and advice, showing that he does care for each of the group members.

<h1>Dean Pelton</h1>
<p> Craig Pelton is the dean of Greendale, who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university and goes to extreme lengths to try to make it fun and politically correct, while frequently explaining his many unresolved business decisions. A man of unclear sexual orientation, he frequently attempts to flirt with Jeff and is an increasingly avid cross-dresser. In season 6, he identifies himself as gay, though he views it as an insufficient label. The study group is by far the Dean's favorite group of students, and he is constantly making up excuses to come talk to them, often by walking into their study room unannounced while wearing a costume in order to tell them about events going on in the school.
